# 10 — Pre-Calibration Workflow

Use `ms_workflow_status(ms_path, workdir)` to probe where you are before starting any step.

## Purpose

This document guides decisions across the full pre-calibration sequence:
online flag assessment → preflag → priorcals → flux model → refant selection
→ initial bandpass → initial RFI flagging on residuals.

The goal is a clean calibrator-only MS with CORRECTED populated and a first
pass of RFI removed, ready for the full calibration solve.

## Step 0 — ASDM triage and ingestion

### 0a — Read the ASDM before converting it

Run `ms_sdm_summary(sdm_path)` first when starting from raw ASDM data. It reads
the ASDM XML directly — no casatools, no conversion — and tells you what the
dataset is before you spend the import on it: telescope and array configuration,
band, per-SPW continuum-vs-line classification, HI-21cm coverage, correlation
products (whether cross-hands are present at all, which decides whether polcal
is even on the table), sources with their intents, scan balance between
calibrators and target, and maximum target elevation.

Use it to answer, before importing:
- Is this the dataset you think it is (right target, right band, right config)?
- Are the cross-hand products there? Without RL/LR there is no polarisation path.
- Is there a flux/bandpass calibrator in the scan list at all?
- Does the target ever rise high enough to be worth calibrating?

A wrong answer here costs one command; the same wrong answer after import costs
the import plus everything built on it.

### 0b — Convert

Run `ms_import_asdm` next if starting from raw ASDM data.

**Always generate the script first (`execute=False`).** The script is short —
review it to confirm the output paths are correct before running.

Fixed parameters (not configurable):
- `ocorr_mode='co'` — cross-correlations only; auto-correlations are dropped
- `savecmds=True` — online flags written to `<ms_name>.flagonline.txt`
- `applyflags=False` — flags are NOT applied during import; `ms_apply_preflag` owns flagging

After running `import_asdm.py`, call `ms_verify_import` to confirm:

| Check | Pass | Fail |
|-------|------|------|
| `ms_valid` | True | MS directory exists but no `table.info` — import failed mid-run |
| `flag_file_exists` | True | `.flagonline.txt` absent — re-run with `savecmds=True` |
| `flag_file_n_commands` | > 0 | Empty file — no online flags recorded (unusual for VLA; note it) |
| `ready_for_preflag` | True | All three above must pass before proceeding |

Pass `online_flag_file` from the `ms_import_asdm` response directly to
`ms_apply_preflag` as its `online_flag_file` parameter.

---

## Step 1 — Online flag assessment

Run `ms_online_flag_stats` on the `.flagonline.txt` file before applying flags.

| Output | What to check | Action |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| `n_commands` | Total online flag commands | > 500 is high — note in summary |
| `n_antennas_flagged` | Number of antennas with online flags | > 5 is elevated — inspect reason breakdown |
| `reason_breakdown` | Per-reason flag counts | `ANTENNA_NOT_ON_SOURCE` dominant = normal; `OUT_OF_RANGE` or `SUBREFLECTOR_ERROR` = antenna problem |

Online flags are applied as-is — do not edit them. They are deterministic hardware records.

---

## Step 2 — Pre-calibration flagging and calibrator split

`ms_apply_preflag` applies five flagging steps in a single pass and splits
calibrators to `calibrators.ms`.

**Always generate the script first (`execute=False`).** Review `preflag_cmds.txt`
before running — it is the complete audit record of what will be flagged.

After running, call `ms_flag_summary(calibrators.ms)` to establish the baseline:

| Flag fraction after preflag | Assessment |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| < 10% | Clean dataset — proceed normally |
| 10–25% | Moderate — note per-antenna distribution; check for outlier antennas |
| 25–40% | Elevated — inspect which reason dominates (shadow? online flags? tfcrop?) |
| > 40% | High — identify the driver before proceeding; may indicate hardware problem |

If a single antenna accounts for > 80% of the flagging, consider excluding it
from `refant` candidates and noting it in the summary.

---

## Step 3 — Prior calibration tables

`ms_generate_priorcals` generates four deterministic tables. After running,
verify with `ms_verify_priorcals`:

| Table | Required | If missing |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| `gain_curves.gc` | Yes — hard stop | Data cannot be calibrated without elevation gain curves |
| `opacities.opac` | K-band and above | Empty table: hard stop at K-band and above; note and continue below K-band |
| `requantizer.rq` | VLA post-2011 only | Safe to skip for pre-WIDAR data; note in summary |
| `antpos.ap` | No | Skip silently if gencal returns empty; note if returned with rows |

A missing `gain_curves.gc` or `opacities.opac` means `gencal` could not access
the telescope correction database. Do not proceed — escalate.

---

## Step 4 — Flux density model (setjy)

`ms_setjy` sets Stokes I flux models for the flux calibrators it finds,
resolving the standard PER FIELD from that field's observing frequency. Do not
pass `standard` — see "Flux standards" in `07-calibration-execution.md` for why
it is an override that skips the frequency check.

**Check the warnings field in the response:**

| Warning | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `CALIBRATOR_RESOLVED_WARNING` | Use the component model listed in the warning, not a point source model |
| 3C84 present | Set `uvrange='>5klambda'` in initial bandpass to exclude extended emission |
| 3C138 present at K/Ka/Q | Source was in flare in early 2025 — note in summary; flux scale may be affected |
| 3C48 present below 4 GHz | PA is unstable at these frequencies — viable for Stokes I only |

The returned `flux_fields` list confirms which fields received a model. A flux
calibrator missing from it is one of two different problems, and the response
separates them:

- In `skipped_fields` — the name did not match a catalogued flux calibrator.
  Check the spelling against `ms_field_list`.
- In `skipped_no_standard` — the source WAS found, but no standard applies at
  its observing frequency. **This is not a naming problem and re-running will
  not fix it.** The reason names the model's validity range and the observed
  span. You need a different flux calibrator for this band. On ALMA that is
  normally a solar-system body; a 3C source at Band 6 is far outside
  Perley-Butler 2017's 50 GHz ceiling.

Also read `n_range_checked`. A solar-system body modelled at a constant
brightness temperature is scaled without any frequency check, because CASA
codes no range for it. That is expected, not a defect — but it means the model
is unverified at your band, so treat a surprising flux scale as plausible
rather than impossible.

**If polarization calibration is in scope for this dataset, call `ms_setjy` with
`usescratch=True`** (default is `False`). `ms_setjy_polcal` forces `usescratch=True`
later, and `usescratch` cannot be mixed within one MS without corrupting the flux
scale. Set it consistently from the start. See skill 09 Step 1 and skill 07 Step 6.

---

## Step 5 — Reference antenna selection

**Score the refant on every calibrator it must serve, not just the bandpass
calibrator.** `ms_refant`'s flag heuristic is computed only over the `field` you
pass it. An antenna can rank top on the bandpass cal yet be heavily flagged on
the phase cal — different scans, elevation, and RFI — and scoring on the BP field
alone is blind to that. The same refant is used for all solves (G0, K, B, and the
gain solve over flux+phase cals), so it must be well populated on all of them. The
phase cal especially: the science target inherits its gain solutions, so a refant
weak on the phase cal corrupts the target even when the bandpass looks perfect.

Run `ms_refant` once per calibrator field and choose the antenna that ranks well
on **all** of them:

```
ms_refant(calibrators.ms, field=bp_field)      → ranked list scored on the BP cal
ms_refant(calibrators.ms, field=phase_field)   → ranked list scored on the phase cal
```

A `flag_score` near 0 means the antenna is fully flagged on that field — never
pick it, however high it ranks on another. Prefer the highest-ranked antenna with
a healthy `flag_score` in every list over the top pick of any single list.

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Candidate `flag_score` near 0 on *any* calibrator field | Disqualify — dead on that field; drop to the next antenna healthy on all fields |
| Top-ranked antenna flagged > 30% (from `ms_flag_summary`) | Use rank-2 antenna |
| Top-ranked antenna has `flag_score` ≫ `geo_score` (periphery of array) | Note this — peripheral refants can cause phase-wrapping on long baselines at high freq |
| Only one heuristic used (completeness flag `INFERRED`) | Accept result but note lower confidence |
| Fewer than 3 antennas scored (`n_antennas` < 3) | Escalate — array is too sparse for reliable refant selection |

Record the top 3 cross-field candidates. If a solve fails or a gain solve flags
heavily, first check whether the refant is weak on that solve's field, then try
the next cross-field candidate before changing other parameters.

For 3C84 observations: pass `uvrange='>5klambda'` to `ms_initial_bandpass`
regardless of refant choice. The extended emission contaminates solutions on
short baselines independent of the reference antenna.

---

## Step 6 — Initial bandpass

`ms_initial_bandpass` runs three CASA tasks in sequence (gaincal → bandpass → applycal)
and populates the CORRECTED column.

**This tool runs casatasks — it can take several minutes on large MSs.**

**Set `applycal_field` to the bandpass calibrator field at this stage.** It is a
required argument with no default. Gains are solved on the bandpass calibrator
only (`bp_field`), so it is the only field with a valid solution. The Step 3
applycal must be restricted to that field — applying to other fields under the
default `applymode='calflagstrict'` flags them for lack of a matching solution
and silently corrupts the FLAG state of every non-BP calibrator (observed on
AB1345). There is no flagversions rollback in this build, so the only recovery
is to re-split `calibrators.ms`. Pass `applycal_field=bp_field` here; reserve
`applycal_field=''` (all fields) for stages where all fields genuinely have
solutions.

If the before/after `ms_flag_summary` delta on the bandpass calibrator is still
unexpectedly high, re-run with `applymode='calflag'` (softer — does not flag on
partial per-polarization solutions).

**Never re-run `ms_initial_bandpass` before the final gain/pol solves.** It is a
one-shot bootstrap to populate CORRECTED for residual rflag on the BP cal — not
something to iterate. If you need a clean FLAG state for the final solves,
re-split `calibrators.ms` rather than re-running this tool.

After the script completes, verify with `ms_verify_caltables`:

| Check | Pass | Fail |
|-------|------|------|
| `init_gain.g` exists | Has rows | Missing or 0 rows → re-run with different `bp_scan` selection |
| `BP0.b` exists | Has rows | Missing or 0 rows → check `bp_field` selection and `refant` |
| `corrected_written` | True | False → applycal silently failed; check MS permissions |

After verification passes, call `ms_plot_caltable_library` on both tables:

```python
ms_plot_caltable_library(
    caltables=[f"{workdir}/init_gain.g", f"{workdir}/BP0.b"],
    workdir=workdir,
)
```

Inspect the HTML dashboard before proceeding. Key things to look for:

| Plot | What to check | Action if bad |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| `init_gain.g` amplitude vs time | Should be smooth, all antennas tracking together | Outlier antenna → exclude from refant list |
| `init_gain.g` phase vs time | Should be near-zero (pre-bandpass short solution) | Large phase jumps → check scan selection; try shorter solint |
| `BP0.b` amplitude vs channel | Should be smooth per antenna; RFI shows as spikes | Persistent spike channels → note for `ms_rfi_channel_stats` after rflag |
| `BP0.b` phase vs channel | Linear slope across band is acceptable; sharp discontinuities are not | Discontinuity → possible missed delay; verify `init_gain.g` passed |
| Flagged fraction in plots | Any antenna with > 30% flagged solutions | If ≥ 1 antenna fully absent from plots → re-check refant choice |

If `ms_plot_caltable_library` returns error entries (any table in the `errors` field), do not proceed — re-run the initial bandpass step.

If either caltable is missing, do not proceed to rflag. Diagnose:
1. Was `bp_field` correct? Cross-check against `ms_field_list` intents.
2. Was the refant heavily flagged on the bandpass calibrator scans? Try rank-2.
3. Were prior caltables passed in `priorcals`? If `opacities.opac` was missing earlier, this will fail silently.

---

## Step 7 — Residual amplitude inspection

Before applying rflag, call `ms_residual_stats(field_id=<bp_field_id>)` to
inspect the CORRECTED − MODEL amplitude distribution.

| p95_amp / median_amp ratio (per SPW) | Interpretation |
|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| < 3 | Clean — bandpass solve succeeded; RFI tail is minimal |
| 3–8 | Moderate tail — rflag at default thresholds (5.0, 5.0) is appropriate |
| > 8 | Heavy tail — strong RFI present; consider running `ms_rfi_channel_stats` first to identify the worst SPWs before rflag |
| Ratio varies widely across SPWs | Band-specific RFI pattern — note which SPWs are worst |

A high ratio in a specific SPW (e.g. SPW 0 at L-band) often indicates persistent
narrowband RFI (GPS, GSM). Cross-check with `ms_rfi_channel_stats` annotations.

---

## Step 8 — Initial RFI flagging on residuals

**`ms_apply_initial_rflag` requires a `field` argument — there is no all-field
default, by design.** Residual rflag is only meaningful on a field whose
CORRECTED column is genuinely calibrated at the point you call it.

**At this stage that field is the bandpass calibrator only (`field={BP_FIELD}`).**
`ms_initial_bandpass` solves gains on the bandpass calibrator alone, so it is the
only field with a valid CORRECTED column right now. On every other field,
CORRECTED−MODEL is dominated by uncorrected gain/phase error — not RFI — so a
residual pass there flags almost the entire field (observed: 9.2% → ~90% overall,
phase cals ~97%), recoverable only by re-splitting the calibrators.

Residual rflag on the *other* calibrators happens later (see 07-calibration-execution.md),
once the full gain solve + applycal has populated valid CORRECTED for them — at
that point you pass those fields instead. The rule is invariant; the specific
field changes with the stage.

`ms_apply_initial_rflag` runs rflag + tfcrop on the residual column in a single
flagdata list-mode pass. `flagbackup=True` saves a versioned backup automatically.

If the phase calibrator minimum elevation during its scans (from `ms_elevation_vs_time`
Phase 2 output) is < 30°, use `timedevscale=7, freqdevscale=7` instead of the
defaults (5, 5). Elevated system temperature at low elevations inflates scatter
and causes false positives at tighter thresholds.

Call `ms_flag_summary` before and after. Assess the flag delta:

| Flag fraction increase (delta) | Assessment |
|-------------------------------|-----------|
| < 5% | Light RFI — dataset is clean; proceed to full calibration |
| 5–15% | Moderate RFI — normal for L-band and below; proceed |
| 15–30% | Heavy RFI — note which fields/SPWs drove the flagging; proceed with caution |
| > 30% | Severe — do not proceed blindly; identify the driver (single bad scan? persistent SPW?) |

If the delta is > 30%, check whether a single scan or SPW accounts for most of it.
A single bad scan can be excluded and the rflag repeated without it.

---

## Decision gate — proceed to full calibration solve?

After Step 8, make a go/no-go decision:

| Condition | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| Overall flag fraction < 30% AND no caltable failures | Proceed to calibration solve |
| Overall flag fraction 30–50% | Proceed with explicit note in summary |
| Overall flag fraction > 50% | Escalate — dataset may not calibrate well |
| Per-calibrator flag fraction ≥ 50% on the gain calibrator | Relax rflag thresholds and re-run Step 8 — do not proceed |
| `gain_curves.gc` missing | Hard stop — do not proceed |
| `opacities.opac` missing at K-band and above | Hard stop — do not proceed |
| Initial bandpass caltables invalid | Hard stop — diagnose before proceeding |
| Specific antenna > 80% flagged | Note and exclude from refant; proceed |

**Refant check:** After Step 8, re-check the chosen refant's flag fraction in
`calibrators.ms`. If it exceeds 50%, switch to the next antenna in the
`refant_list` from `ms_refant` and re-run Step 6 (initial bandpass) before
passing to the calibration solve.

Pass the following forward to the calibration solve:
- `refant`: top-ranked surviving antenna from `ms_refant`
- `priorcals`: list from `ms_verify_priorcals`
- `bp_field`: the bandpass calibrator field selection
- `workdir`: directory containing `init_gain.g` and `BP0.b`
