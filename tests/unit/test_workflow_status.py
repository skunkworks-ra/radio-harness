"""
Unit tests for tools/workflow_status.py.

What these cover: the branch between "this stage has not happened yet" and
"the probe for this stage failed", and the split between the stage log (what
COMPLETED, as history) and the MS probes (what is TRUE NOW). Fake MS directory
trees and a patched open_table. No CASA is involved.

The old version of this docstring said the tests did not cover "whether the
filesystem heuristics for priorcals, caltables and images match what the
ms_modify tools really write". They did not match — the tool held a hardcoded
list of caltable NAMES while those paths are arguments the caller chooses —
and that was the defect. The heuristics are gone; state comes from
stage_log.jsonl, which the tools write themselves.

What these still do NOT cover: whether open_table raises on a real locked or
corrupt CASA table. That needs a real MS.
