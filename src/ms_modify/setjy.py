"""
setjy.py — ms_setjy

Sets flux density models for the catalogued flux calibrators in an MS, each
with the standard that applies AT ITS OWN OBSERVING FREQUENCY.

Logic:
  1. Read field names, and each field's observed frequency span, from the MS.
  2. Cross-match against the bundled calibrator catalogue.
  3. Resolve a standard PER FIELD via calibrators.resolve_flux_standard().
  4. Write one setjy() call per field, each with its own standard.
  5. Warn if 3C84 (resolved), 3C138, or 3C48 (variable/partially polarized).

Why per field: an MS can need two standards at once. The ALMA case is exactly
that — Ceres on a solar-system model plus a quasar on Perley-Butler — and a
single run-level standard cannot express it. The same tool previously applied
'Perley-Butler 2017' to every flux field regardless of band, which silently
mis-scales any field observed outside that model's 0.05-50 GHz validity.

The resolution lives in ms_inspect.util.calibrators, NOT here, because
ms_field_list reports the same answer. If the two drifted, the tool that acts
would be the one that is wrong.

Does NOT set polarization angle models (see CALPOL.md).

                    its full polarized model is set by ms_setjy_polcal
                    (usescratch=True), and a plain Stokes-I setjy on that field
                    would overwrite the polarization (MODEL is last-writer-wins
                    per field). Excluded fields still get a consistent physical
                    MODEL_DATA from ms_setjy_polcal, so usescratch consistency
                    is preserved.
        usescratch: If True (default), fill the physical MODEL_DATA column (so
                    ms_residual_stats and polarization calibration work). If
                    False, write a virtual model (no MODEL_DATA column).

                    must use usescratch=True here too. Mixing the two leaves the
                    virtual-model fields at MODEL_DATA=1 Jy and corrupts the
                    flux scale (fluxscale comes out order-of-magnitude low).
        execute:    If False (default), write setjy.py and return.
