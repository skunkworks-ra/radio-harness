tclean.py — ms_tclean

Generate a first-pass imaging script using CASA tclean.

All imaging parameters are accepted explicitly — no parameter derivation
is done inside this tool. See skill 11-imaging.md for derivation logic.

When execute=False (default), writes a self-contained script to
workdir/tclean_<imagename_stem>.py and returns immediately. Run it
externally as a background job; tclean on a real mosaic can take hours.

    Generate (and optionally execute) a tclean imaging script.

    Validates that CORRECTED_DATA exists in the MS before writing the script.
    pbcor=True is always set — primary beam correction is applied by tclean.

    Args:
        ms_path:     Path to the full Measurement Set.
        imagename:   Base name for all output image products (no suffix).
        field:       CASA field selection for science target(s).
        workdir:     Existing directory for script and image output.
        spw:         CASA SPW selection (default '' = all SPWs). Use to drop
                     RFI-dominated SPWs, e.g. '0~8,10~15' to exclude SPW 9.
        stokes:      Stokes products to image (default 'I').
        specmode:    'mfs', 'cube', or 'mvc' (default 'mfs'). Use 'mvc' with
                     gridder='awp2' — awp2 does not implement conjbeams, and
                     plain 'mfs' needs several major cycles to converge the
                     wideband flux normalization.
        deconvolver: 'hogbom', 'multiscale', or 'mtmfs' (default 'hogbom').
        nterms:      Taylor terms for mtmfs (default None; pass 2 for mtmfs).
        scales:      Multi-scale component sizes in pixels, e.g. [0, 4, 12, 36]
                     (0 = point). Used by 'multiscale' and 'mtmfs' only; CASA
                     ignores it for 'hogbom', so do not spend effort deriving
                     scales for a hogbom run. 'multiscale' without scales is
                     hogbom under another name (CASA defaults to [0]).
        gridder:     'standard', 'wproject', or 'awp2' (default 'standard').
        wprojplanes: W-projection planes (None = omit; set for wproject/awp2
                     when W-terms are required per Fresnel criterion). If
                     omitted for those gridders, CASA silently defaults to 1
                     (no W-projection) — a warning is emitted in the response.
        cfcache:     Convolution-function cache path. Applies to
                     gridder='awproject' only (awp2 does not use a cfcache).
                     Without it, awproject recomputes CFs from scratch on
                     every run — potentially many hours.
        cell:        Cell size string, e.g. '2.5arcsec'.
        imsize:      Image size as [nx, ny] (default [512, 512]). The tool
                     measures the field of view the selection needs (mosaic
                     extent + 3 x PB FWHM at the lowest selected frequency)
                     and warns when imsize x cell is short; never resizes.
        weighting:   UV weighting scheme (default 'briggs').
        robust:      Briggs robust parameter (default 0.5).
        niter:       Maximum clean iterations (default 50000).
        threshold:   Clean stopping threshold, e.g. '0.5mJy'.
        pblimit:     Primary-beam gain cutoff. Default -0.01 (negative disables
                     PB-based blanking, so low-gain regions and sources out in
                     the PB sidelobes stay visible in the image — important for
                     spotting outliers). CASA's own default is 0.2, which blanks
                     everything below 20% PB.
        savemodel:   'modelcolumn' writes MODEL_DATA for self-cal (default).
        nchan:       Number of output channels for the cube (specmode='cube'
                     only; None = all). For a polarization frequency cube,
                     one plane per SPW-chunk per skill 11.
        start:       First channel of the cube as a CASA spectral string, e.g.
                     '1.0GHz' or '0' (specmode='cube' only).
        width:       Channel width of the cube, e.g. '64MHz' or '4'
                     (specmode='cube' only).
        outframe:    Output spectral reference frame, e.g. 'LSRK' (specmode=
                     'cube' only). None lets CASA default.
        execute:     If False (default), write script and return.
                     If True, run tclean in-process (intended for test data only).

    Returns:
        Standard response envelope with script_path always present.
        When execute=True, also includes imagename and completed flag.
