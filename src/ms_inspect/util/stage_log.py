"""
stage_log.py — the workdir stage log, written by generated scripts and read by
ms_workflow_status.

A reduction's state cannot be inferred from the filesystem: every writing tool
takes its caltable path as a caller-chosen argument, so no fixed set of names
can be searched for. The log replaces inference with a record: each generated
script appends one line per product it writes, after CASA returns, so a line
exists only if that step actually completed. It is append-only — a retry adds
a line rather than destroying the previous one.

Placed in ms_inspect because it is the package ms_modify and ms_create both
already import from; ms_inspect never imports either of them. The snippet is
embedded verbatim into generated scripts, so it must stay dependency-free and
self-contained — same contract as pathguard.SAFE_RM_TABLE_SNIPPET.

Two limits, both deliberate:

- The check is existence only, not proof the solve produced solutions.
- A script killed outright (SIGKILL, OOM, disk full) writes no line at all.
  The log explains a failure; it does not detect every one. The driver's
  recorded exit code remains the outer truth.
