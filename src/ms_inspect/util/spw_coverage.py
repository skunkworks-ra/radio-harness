"""
util/spw_coverage.py — Solve-vs-target spectral-window coverage guardrail.

A calibration solve (bandpass / delay / gain) produces a caltable that is later
applied to the science target and the phase-transfer calibrators. If the field
solved on does not carry the spectral windows those downstream fields need, the
applied solution flags the uncovered SpWs — and the failure typically surfaces
several stages later (e.g. as fluxscale "Cannot find solutions for transfer
field(s)") rather than at solve time.

The pathological case: a single physical source recorded under two field IDs
with *disjoint* SpW coverage, where the target's SpWs live only in the field
not chosen for the solve. Solving on the wrong field silently flags everything
downstream.

This module surfaces the cal-field-vs-target SpW sets at solve time. The set math
(`evaluate_coverage`) is pure and CASA-free; `check_spw_coverage` is the thin
msmd wrapper used by the ms_modify solve tools.

Policy:
  * SpW-coverage mismatches are WARN-only (returned to the caller's warnings[]).
  * If the target/transfer fields cannot be inferred from intents and the caller
    passed no explicit target_fields, the wrapper STOPS (raises ComputationError)
    rather than guessing — the agent surfaces it to the user.
  * If msmd cannot be opened at all (no CASA, stub MS, script-generation on a
    path without metadata), the check degrades silently to no warnings.
