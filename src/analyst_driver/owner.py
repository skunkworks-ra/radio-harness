"""Run ownership: who is driving a run, and whether that is still true.

``<run_root>/<run_key>/owner.json`` records the driver process that holds a
run, and the scheduler job it currently has in flight. It is written when a
driver takes a run and removed when the driver leaves it cleanly, so a file
left behind means the driver died there.

An advisory lock is deliberately NOT used. ``fcntl.flock`` releases itself
when the holder dies, which is the property we want, but it is unreliable
over NFS and the run root is expected on both local and NFS storage. A
recorded identity that the reader probes is portable; the cost is that the
probe must answer honestly when it cannot check.

Three probe answers, and the difference between the last two is load-bearing:

- ``alive``   the recorded process exists on this host, with the start time
              recorded for it. Proof. A caller must refuse.
- ``dead``    this host, and the process is gone or the pid was recycled.
- ``unknown`` the record names another host. A pid there is unverifiable from
              here, so we never call it dead.

The pid start time defeats pid reuse. Without it a recycled pid reports a
crashed driver as alive, and the run can never be resumed. Drivers run on
both Linux and macOS (no ``/proc`` there), so the start-time check has two
backends: ``/proc/<pid>/stat`` on Linux, ``ps -o lstart=`` elsewhere. The
value is opaque outside this module — an int on Linux, a string on macOS —
and is only ever compared for equality, never parsed as a timestamp.

SLURM is reported separately, not folded into the driver answer. A job that
outlives its driver is normal for ``executor = "slurm"``, and ``sacct`` is
authoritative from any submit node where a pid is meaningless.
