"""The turn (PLAN.md steps 4, 5): sense, decide, read the result, dispatch,
record — plus the pure functions each stage uses.

The driver stays alive and waits for its jobs (user decision, 2026-08-31).
``Loop.step`` runs one whole turn for one run, including the wait; with
``block=False`` it advances a run only when its job has finished, so
``run --all`` can interleave several runs.

The driver may report a number. It may never name a verdict. ``check_citations``
records both sides of every cited value and refuses nothing; the only stop is
a decision that names no usable script. ``outcome`` is mechanics, not science:
exit code 0 is ``accepted``, anything else is ``failed``.

Declared scope for this run: {scope}

Previous turn: {previous}

Do this, in order:
1. Consult the radio-interferometry skill for the stage the status names.
2. Inspect with read-only ms_inspect tools as needed.
3. Call exactly ONE writing tool with execute=False so it writes a script
   into the work directory. Do not execute anything yourself. The writing
   tools are the ms_modify server AND the ms_create server — at the
   import_asdm stage the tool you need is ms_import_asdm, from ms_create,
   and it takes the raw input path above, not an MS.
4. End your reply with one JSON object, nothing after it:
   {{"script": "<path to the generated script>",
     "tool": "<the tool you called>",
     "stage": "<the stage this advances>",
     "cited": [{{"name": "...", "value": ..., "source": "<file you read it from>"}}],

   Only "script" is required. At the import stage name the MS the script will
   write as an output with kind "ms": that is how the loop learns where the
   MS is, and the run cannot continue without it.
5. If the reduction has reached the declared scope above, or is otherwise
   finished with no stage remaining, reply instead with
   {{"done": true, "notes": "<why it is finished>"}} and name no script.
   Only you can say this: ms_workflow_status reports "selfcal_or_done" and
