"""Backend contract + claude, opencode, codex adapters (PLAN.md step 6).

One contract: a command that takes a prompt non-interactively and returns
text on stdout. Each adapter also does its best to extract the tool calls the
turn made, the model name and the token usage — recorded when the backend can
report them, null when it cannot. A parse failure anywhere degrades to raw
stdout as ``text``; the loop treats an unusable decision as a retryable turn,
never a run failure.

Capability notes per backend:

- ``claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose`` — full event stream:
  tool calls, tool results, model, token usage.
- ``opencode run --format json`` — raw JSON events; tool events extracted
  best-effort.
- ``codex exec --json`` — event stream (unverified here; codex is not
  installed on the dev machine). codex does not read SKILL.md, so its adapter
  prepends the skill file paths to the prompt.
